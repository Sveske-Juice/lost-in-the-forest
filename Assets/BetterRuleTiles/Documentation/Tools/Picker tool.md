# Picker tool

The [[Picker tool]] is useful to quickly switch between tiles or sprites that you've already placed on the [[Grid]]. To select the picker tool you can select it from the [[Toolbar]] or with [[Keyboard shortcuts]] (I).

To use the picker tool you just simply select it and than click on the sprite or tile you want to select. After selecting a tile or sprite the tool will be automatically switched to the [[Brush]] tool so you can draw without selecting another tool. 

If a grid cell contains both a tile and a sprite, the sprite will be picked. If the cell is empty nothing will be picked and the picker tool will stay as the selected tool.
