# Brush tool

The [[Brush]] tool is one of the most important port of the editor, if you want to paint tiles or sprites you need to use the [[Brush]] tool.

To use the brush just select it from the [[Toolbar]] or by using [[Keyboard shortcuts]] and start drawing on the grid by pressing and holding down your left mouse button. The brush will use the selected sprite or tile shown in the [[Tile drawer]]. If there's nothing selected, the brush will not do anything.

# Hiding sprites

Sprites and tiles are on two separate layers, when drawing with sprites you'll draw on top the tiles, without affecting those. When drawing with tiles you'll draw them under the sprites. Because of this some tiles may be hidden when drawing under sprites, you can combat this by enabling the **hide sprites** option on the [[Toolbar]]. This will hide the sprites so you can see what is under them.

# Erasing tiles

The brush toll is not only used to draw tiles and sprites but to erase tiles as well. To erase tiles you just need to select the **Delete** tile from the [[Tile drawer]] and use that to draw. Using this will override any tile with an empty rule.
