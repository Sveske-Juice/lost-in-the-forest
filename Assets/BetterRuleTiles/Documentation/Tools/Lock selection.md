When a selection is locked, all the locked cells will be displayed with a red outline by default. You can change how the locked cells look in the [[Editor settings]].

When a cell is locked, it won't allow you to modify the sprite or tile with the [[Brush]] or [[Eraser]] tools, you won't be able to move them with the [[Move tool]] or delete them when pressing **Delete**.
