# Grid

The grid is the heart of the tool. This is where you place [[Tile]]s and [[Sprite]]s to create [[Tiling rule]]s.

There are 3 different types of grids you can work in: **Square**, **Isometric** and **Hexagonal**, with the hexagonal grid having two variations: **pointed topped** and **flat topped**. You can change the grid type in the [[Export options]] window, which can be found in the most right side of the [[Toolbar]]. You can further customize how the grid appears in the [[Editor settings]] window. which can be found right next to the [[Export options]] button.

> It's best to change the grid type before you start working on anything, to avoid displacement of the grid due to the different coordinate systems.
