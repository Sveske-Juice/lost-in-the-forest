# Sprite drawer

The sprite drawer is a window inside the editor where you can pick sprites to draw with.

# Adding sprites to the drawer

You can add sprites to the sprite drawer in different ways. You can directly drag and drop sprites into the drawer. When adding sprites directly to the drawer you can select as many sprites or texture files as you want, all of them will be added to the drawer. The second way is to drop them directly to the grid. Every sprite that's on the grid will be automatically added to the drawer. When dropping sprites to the grid directly, you can select multiple sprites, but only one texture file. More on this behavior in the [[Sprite]] page.

Based on the **Save sprite drawer** setting in the [[Editor settings]] window, the sprites which are not used on the grid will not be remembered when opening the editor, but if this option is set to true, all of the sprites will stay in the drawer.

# Using the sprite drawer

Using the drawer is self explanatory, you just click a sprite in the drawer to select it. The selected sprite will be displayed on the left side of the [[Tile drawer]] window. When picking a sprite the [[Brush]] tool will be selected automatically so you can start drawing immediately after picking a sprite. 

You can also expand the window to show more sprites at once by clicking the small arrow in the top right corner of the window. With this button you can also collapse the window to its original size.

# Sprite drawer settings

In the [[Editor settings]] window you can change a few settings on how the drawers should appear and behave. More info on this on the [[Editor settings]] page.
