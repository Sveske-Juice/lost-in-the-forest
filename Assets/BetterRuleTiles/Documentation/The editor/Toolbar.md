# Toolbar

The toolbar is the row of buttons and toggles on top of the [[Editor window]] where you can access everything you need to use this tool. It's divided into sections by horizontal double lines, so the different types of tools are separated into different groups.

- **[[Move tool]] (M)** - Move a selection
- **[[Selection tool]] (S)** - Select an area
- **[[Grid cell inspector]] (E)** - Inspect a grid cell

# Actions

In the next group you have a few actions:
- **Undo (Ctrl + Z)** - Undoes your last action
- **Redo (Ctrl + Y)** - Redoes your last action
- **Delete selection (Delete)** - Deletes the area selected with the [[Selection tool]]
- **Copy (Ctrl + C)** - Copies the currently area selected with the [[Selection tool]] to the clipboard

# Export options 

Going to the right side of the toolbar, on the top right corner you'll find the [[Export options]], where you can change the most important settings for the editor, like changing the [[Grid]] type. You can also change settings for exporting and of course you can find the export button here.

# Settings

Continuing to the left side you'll find the settings group. You'll find a few options for changing the appearance of the editor:
- **[[Editor settings]]** - Change settings of the editor grid and the editor windows
- **Hide sprites** - Hides the [[Sprite]]s so you can see what [[Tile]] is under them
- **Snap windows** - Snap windows or allow them to be moved
- **Show coordinates** - Show the grid coordinates on the side of the editor
- **Highlight modified cells** - Highlight cells modified by the [[Grid cell inspector]] with a flashing outline

# Sprite windows

In the next section you'll see one or two buttons, depending on your settings in the [[Export options]]. With the first button you can show or hide the [[Sprite drawer]]. The other button will show or hide the [[Sprite override settings]]. You can only have one window open at a time.

# Extras

The last group contains extras:
