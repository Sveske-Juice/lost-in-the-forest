# Editor window

The better rule tiles editor window is the place where the magic happens. You access it by creating a [[Better rule tile container]] asset and opening it. When you open an editor window the first things you'll see are the:
- The [[Grid]]
- The [[Toolbar]]
- And the [[Tile drawer]]

Use the [[Tile drawer]] to start creating tiles, and than use the tools in the [[Toolbar]] to draw on the [[Grid]].

You can also open the [[Tile inspector]] by selecting a tile that you've created in the [[Tile drawer]]. Or you can enable the [[Sprite drawer]], where you can pick sprites to draw with the tools. 

You can change settings about the editor in the [[Editor settings]] dropdown and when you finished you can use the [[Export options]] dropdown to [[Export]] your tiles.
