If you have two separat tiles and you want them to connect to each other, just simply select the tiles in the tile drawer, and un the "tile info panel" under the "connect to" option you can select tiles that the tile you're editing will connect to. Any tile specified in this option will be treated as it were the same tile, and will connect to it.

You can also create interactions with other tiles by drawing them on the grid. That way you can create specific transitions between different tiles.
