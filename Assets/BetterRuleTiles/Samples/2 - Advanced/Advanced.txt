If you want more precise control over how the rules are generated, you can create the rules in a similar way that you would've created by default. You just simply need to mark the the neighbors where it would connect with the same tile, and mark neighbhors that will not connect with the "not same" tile.

This method is perfect for more advanced users, as it offers quicker rule creation and more control over how the tiles connect. This method can also be used alongside the "simplify rules" option, to enable even more possibilities.
