The simplify rules option simplifies the output rules to fit every possible situation, given that you've provided enough samples.

With enough samples provided this is the easiest way of creating rule tiles using this tool, just draw out the shapes with the tiles, mark the empty spaces around the tiles with the "not same" rule, and fill in the sprites.
